The parrot learned to mimic the doorbell perfectly, causing the owner to run to the door multiple times a day. 
One day, the owner decided to ignore the sound, thinking it was just the parrot again. 
To their surprise, it was actually the delivery person, who had been waiting outside for quite a while.

I hope that made you laugh! If you need more stories or anything else, just let me know!
