The cat decided it was time to learn how to use the computer. 
It jumped onto the keyboard and started typing random letters. 

Suddenly, the screen flashed, and the cat had accidentally ordered 100 cans of tuna online. 
The delivery arrived the next day, and the cat was the happiest feline in the neighborhood. 
The owner, however, was left wondering how to explain the massive tuna bill to their bank.

I hope that brought a smile to your face! If you need more stories or anything else, just let me know!
